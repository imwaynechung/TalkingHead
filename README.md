```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist` folder.

## How to Get Your Avatar

### Option 1: Create Your Own Avatar

1. Visit [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/avatar)

3. Once created, you'll get a URL like: `https://models.readyplayer.me/YOUR_ID.glb`
4. Copy this URL
5. Paste it into the app and click "Load Avatar"

### Option 2: Use Sample Avatar

### Database Schema

The `profiles` table stores user settings:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Profile name
- `voice`: Selected voice index
- `rate`: Speech rate
- `pitch`: Speech pitch
- `volume`: Speech volume
- `eyeContact`: Eye contact level
- `headMove`: Head movement level
- `mute`: Mute status
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support (requires WebGL)
- Mobile: Limited support (may vary by device)

## Troubleshooting

### Avatar Won't Load
- **Check the URL**: Make sure you're using a valid Ready Player Me URL
- **Try sample avatar**: Click "Try Sample Avatar" to verify the app works
- **Check internet**: Ensure you have a stable connection
- **Browser compatibility**: Ensure your browser supports WebGL
- **CORS issues**: Ready Player Me avatars must be accessed from their official domain
- **Refresh**: If all else fails, refresh the page and try again

### Invalid Avatar URL
- The URL must start with `https://models.readyplayer.me/`
- It should end with `.glb`
- The morphTargets parameter is added automatically

### No Speech Output
- Check system volume
- Verify browser has speech synthesis support (most modern browsers support it)
- Try selecting a different voice from the dropdown
- Ensure the "Mute" checkbox is not checked
- The app requires a user interaction first (clicking a button) before audio can play
- If you see speech errors in the console, the app will automatically try a fallback mode
- Try refreshing the page if voices don't load properly
- Some browsers may have limited voice support - check the voice dropdown for available options

### Lip-Sync Not Working
- Lip-sync is handled separately from audio and should work even without sound
- Make sure the avatar is fully loaded before trying to speak
- Check browser console for TalkingHead library errors
- Try the mute checkbox - lips should still move when muted
- Speech audio comes from Web Speech API, lip-sync comes from TalkingHead library

### Profiles Won't Save
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure database table exists
- Check internet connection

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:
- Multiple avatar selection
- Custom avatar upload
- Microphone input for live lip-sync
- Animation timeline editor
- Background customization
- Lighting controls
- Screenshot/video recording
